1.3	Scope
As noted in the feasibility study, the developing team will develop a healthy food and lifestyle application for the smartphone market that will allow users to search, share and take snapshots of healthy meals. 
The primary objective of developing a healthy food app is to promote a healthy lifestyle to the general public as well as providing the necessary tools for individuals to follow a correct healthy lifestyle. To achieve this, the application will allow the functionality of an ORAC rating which will rate the health standard of the meal. A list of ingredients and the meals location can also be viewed.
By developing an app that promotes healthy living, it provides benefits to not only towards its users but as well as the client organisation ‘Cadence Health’. Users are benefited by this app through cost savings, time savings and overall a better wellbeing to society. The client also benefits through this app as it provides a better communication medium towards its users and the general publics. In return this can potentially improve the brand image of Cadence Health. 
The goals and objective listed above will need to be achieved through communication between its stakeholders such as the client, target audience and the group members. 
This report outlines the planned initial release of the system. Initially the app will be expected to grow in information overtime as users will be able to share their meals and data onto the app. Further updates can also be added and be built upon. Before the initial release, there will be two separate prototypes that will outline the basis and functionality of the app which will be further improved through testing. It is expected that the app will provide users with an increased understanding of health tips, meal information and health awareness which represents the foundations for achieving the above benefits and objectives.
