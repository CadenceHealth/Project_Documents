1.1	Overview

This report will demonstrate the proper requirements for software development, which will provide further understanding of the system when designing and developing the application. It is divided into three clauses. Clause 1 introduces the new proposed application and provides a detailed overview of the purpose of developing this new application. This is then followed on with the overall scope of the system requirements specifications. The scope will provide relevant benefits, goals and objectives to business strategies. A list of definitions, abbreviations, acronyms and references will also be noted. 
Clause 2 describes the overall description of the proposed application.  This includes a brief of the product perspective, the product functions, the user classes & characteristics, operating environment and user documentation. The product perspective describes the context of system including the overall use of the application, the components of the application and how it connects with the system objectives. Product functions will summarise the major functions of the application. User classes will allow the readers to understand the system application in clear context. Furthermore, the operating environment will note the necessary hardware and software requirements. Finally the user documentation discusses how application users will be guided through the use of tutorials via the system.  
Clause 3 discusses the requirements of the system and goes through the functional and non-functional requirements.  The functional requirements will be a dot point list describing what the application must be able to do. Performance requirements and design implantation requirements will also be noted, constraints will also be followed. Clause 3 will also go through any non-functional requirements describing how the proposed system will be able achieve system objectives.
