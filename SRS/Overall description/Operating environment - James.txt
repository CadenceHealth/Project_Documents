The Application must be supportted by Android and IOS. The software for the Application must be written in a language that allows for it to be compatible for possible web browser use.
The Application must be downloadable by either Android's 'Play Store', or Apples 'App Store' at all times. A direct link through the Clients website will be supplied for easy access to the downloadable Application.
This allows for all software and harware platforms to access the system without compatibility issues and will also prevent vendor lock in and support future upgrades.
Future implementation for an application based interface may also be considered, with the possibility of running on Windows or OSX computers.

The Application must be compatible with ALL smartphones that run Android 4.1.1 and above. 
The Application must be compatible with ALL iPhones that run IOS 6 and above.

The Application data-storage and server-side components will require a web server to store and access data of the Applications users. This will allow information to be stored from any user and populate a searchable and sortable database for ALL users. 
It is not anticipated that the Application will place an onerous strain on server resources and therefore the use of a web server hosting the database will be adequate until such a time that the strain deems it necessary to updrage the server-side compnents. 

The Application must be available for 24 hour use, 7 days a week with 100% certainty. Updates will be released and notify the users to download at their leisure. 
The Application must be available to use both offline and online, noting that full functionality will only be supported while online.
Note that future versions of the Application may demand enchanced hardware and/or the upgrade of the server-side components.
